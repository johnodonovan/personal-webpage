Project Proposal:

Problem / Application Idea / Overall Project Goal: Being
healthy in today's society is very difficult. To make staying
healthy easier, we are proposing an application that tracks
various data that helps in maintaining good health, like
exercise data. By tracking sets, reps, laps, miles ran, pounds
lifted, etc., our app will help to show the user their progress
in staying / becoming healthy over time, as well as provide
useful interpretations of their data over time. Our application
will allow the user to enter this data in an easy, quick
manner, regardless of whether the user is a novice or an expert
user of the application, with maximum retention over time, and
minimum time to learn. Our app will be modular, and easily
scalable, to allow for more features over time in multiple
activities. Our application will be based on data input by the
user, along with storing past data to track progress over time.
