	<blockquote>
		<p><font face="Arial">You are hired as a usability expert to design the
		GUI to a new killer application for a line of new smart phones, which
		are small enough to carry with you all the time, yet have a sufficiently
		big screen to use for serious applications. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The task you have to solve with your application
		is that of letting the user log their activities during a day, down to
		15 minute intervals, meaning there can be up to 4 entries per hour and
		these entries always start on the hour h, at h:15, h:30, and h:45.&nbsp;
		It should be as easy as possible for a user to arrive at a consecutive
		list of activities without any holes in between. For activities that
		take less than 15 minutes, the user will decide under what label and
		category to log the corresponding 15 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<p><font face="Arial">For simplification purposes, please assume that
		you are only tracking the period of exactly one day (24 hours), with no
		carrying over from the previous day or to the next day. It simply starts
		and ends at midnight.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The purpose is to make
		the application easy to use even for novice users, but also make it very
		efficient, since users will only fill in information on the fly if it is
		extremely easy to do. &nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<p><font face="Arial">At least the following functionality should be
		supported:&nbsp; </font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial">Log entries should have a category and a
			label associated with them. </font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">Categories should at least include the
			following:</font><ul>
			<li><font face="Arial">Work</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">Sleep and Rest</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">Personal</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">On the Move</font></li>
		</ul></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">Users should have the ability to define their
			own categories</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">Labels should be free form text up to 20
			characters</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">The user should be able to select and
			annotate blocks of arbitrary length (15 min to 24 hours).</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">The user should be able to get an easy
			overview of what categories take the most time of the day.&nbsp;
			</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial">As always, you should obviously start with a user
		and a task analysis and optimize "performance" of your UI accordingly.
		Here is a small scenario story blurb as a starting point. Please list
		any further assumptions you make about your main target user group.&nbsp;
		<br>
		<br>
		"Chris is an undergraduate at UCSB with a very full quarter class
		schedule and a lot of extracurricular activities, including breakdancing,
		Lacrosse, and leading a study group on Astronomy. She also works
		part-time as a desk clerk for the Office of International Students and
		Scholars. She bikes to and from school, which takes her 15 minutes each
		way. She has a boyfriend whom she sees on a daily basis, and she has a
		clique of four "best friends" that she hangs out with regularly, for
		example at various Happy Hours.&nbsp; With that many activities, it is
		not surprising that she needs all the sleep that she can get. She
		averages about 7 hours per day. Chris likes to keep track of how she
		spends her time, and updates the log on her smart phone pretty regularly
		in between her activities. Sometimes, life is just to hectic to do that,
		however. In those cases she goes back in later and fills in several past
		tasks in one group. Chris has quite a few specific tasks that occur over and
		over again on a regular basis, even multiple times a day (e.g.,
		"commute", "desk service", "study", "walk campus", etc.) .&nbsp; She
		likes to keep track of the names of the friends she hangs out with."&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Use this scenario and come up with a couple of 
		your own (which you should document and submit), to determine the exact
		functionality of your logging application. All the tasks that occur
		should be dealt with efficiently in your UI. Again, if it is complicated
		to do, people will not want to do it on a regular basis. Even though
		your UI is simplified to log only one day, the assumption is that the
		application would be used every single day to log all of the user's
		activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The program should work on your phone's resolution 
		(which you document). You are strongly encouraged to handle different 
		screen sizes and dynamic portrait/landscape adaptation. Note your work 
		on this topic in your documentation.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">You need to submit documentation (basically a 
		&quot;user's manual&quot;) for your application as well as all the other materials 
		listed on the Project description page.
