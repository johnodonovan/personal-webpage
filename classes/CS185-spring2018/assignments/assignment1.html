The goal of this assignment is to apply your knowledge about the history of HCI, current 
technologies, user interface possibilities and the UI design guidelines from DTUI, chapter 2 to a careful analysis of the 
Apple Knowledge Navigator, SUN Starfire,  and Microsoft 2019 videos. </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="5">As a reminder: </font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Arial" size="5">The Knowledge Navigator (Handout H3) video was created in 
	1987, and the story takes place in Sept. 2011</font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial" size="5">The SUN Starfire video (Handouts H2, BM1, BM2) was created in 1993, 
	and its story takes place in 2004.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial" size="5">The Microsoft 2019 video (H4) was created in 
	2009, and it projects technology use in 2019. <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="5" color="#FF0000">Please address the following tasks/questions (in writing): </font> 

  
 
</p>
<ol>
	<li><font face="Arial" size="5"><i>List five technologies from the Knowledge Navigator video that were not around in 1987, but are in widespread use today<br>
	</i>Order your five examples 
	by decreasing commonality today, i.e., list the most commonly used, established 
  features first.<br>
	</font><br>
  </li>
	
    <li><font face="Arial" size="5"><i>List five technolgies/concepts from the Knowledge Navigator video that are still 
      out of reach today</i>  Order the features by decreasing blatancy of the misjudgment, i.e., list the 
      most obviously unachieved features first.</font><font face="Arial" size="5"><br>

  The next two questions are summary insights from all 
    three videos considered together: </font><br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="5">In <b>one short summary paragraph</b>, 
    describe a trajectory of technological developments between 1987 and today. 
    List 5 milestone human-computer interaction developments in this time 
    period and their approximate time of occurrence.&nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="5">State <b>in what overall areas the video 
    makers were correct</b> in their predictions, and <b>in what main areas they 
      misjudged technological and social development</b>. If you think that there are commonalities among the videos regarding this question, you can lump them together in your answer. Otherwise, give one answer per video. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">The next two questions (of which only the second one requires a written answer) refer to the 3 videos as well as the assigned 
    reading from the DTUI handouts listed on the class schedule.&nbsp; </font>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="5"><font color="#808080">No written answer required for this 
    question: (Re-)Read DTUI, Sections 2.2.* (H6). Compare the 
    guidelines from the sections in 2.2 with the interfaces in the video. 
    On first impression you will find that many guidelines apply to interfaces 
    of a quite different kind than portrayed in the videos. Still, make 
    the effort and think about examples of how some of the guidelines are implemented 
    in interfaces from the video.</font><br>&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="5">Read DTUI Sections 2.3.* (H6). <br>a) Which interaction styles (2.3.3) are predominant in the videos?<br>
    b) Give five examples (total, not per video) of how some of the eight golden rules of interface 
    design are complied with in any of the videos' interfaces. Give two examples of 
    where a golden design rule is violated. State your reasoning. <br><br>
    <font color="#FF0000">Finally, give your own outlook in your answer to the 
    last question: </font><br>
  &nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="5">List <b>five possible future developments, </b>not appearing dominantly in any of the videos, 
    on how we might interact with computers in years to come. Order these five 
    by your estimate of when they might be realized - write down that estimate, 
    too. In order to answer this question, think about the following: If you had 
    to conceptualize and direct a video like the three examples we showed you, today, what 
    would it look like?
