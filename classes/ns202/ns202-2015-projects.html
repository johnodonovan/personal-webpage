<h1><font face="Arial">Group Project Presentations <br>
Network Science 202 - Winter 2015</font></h1>

<p><font face="Arial">The goal of the quarter project for this class is to 
create an application that demonstrates some advanced Network Science 
techniques in a useful setting. You may work alone or in teams of up to three 
people (exceptions possible).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<a href="https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/mod/resource/view.php?id=307096">
This powerpoint slide set</a> provides some information on the intended scope of 
the project. In particular, please consider your choices for Network Data, 
Model, Algorithm, Interface, and Interaction. Note that your project can focus 
on one or more of these aspects but should have <i>some</i> methodology (however 
simple) in place for <i>each</i> of these, and should spell this out. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Please make sure that your group participants and project 
plans are correctly reflected in the emerging
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bne2zbltYJd0J0N94-T57CG42I_ZaxINPQoeqs2amQ8/">
Google Doc</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Your group will make a brief 
presentation in class on Thursday 02/26, and we will give you 
first feedback on the magnitude/feasibility of the
project, possibly suggest modifications to better fit the deadline, and point 
you to material you might find useful. </font>  
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Over the next week you will refine the plan 
and put together a formal 2 page project proposal (due on Tuesday, March 3, 
23:59:59), which will be presented and critiqued in class on Thu,
    March 5. We will discuss project progress, first visuals if applicable, and provide 
interactive feedback to the groups. Final presentations will take place on 
Tuesday, March 17, 8-11am.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

	<li><font face="Arial">Tue, March 17, 8-11am: Final Project presentations, 
	final documentation due at midnight that same day.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial">We encourage you to discuss your project with us before the 
various deadlines, so we can give feedback earlier. <b><br>
&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial"><b>Development Environments:</b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">You are free to use any programming language<b> </b>and 
development environment of your choice, and any hardware platform you have 
access to that can easily be brought to our class room for demonstration. </font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial"><b>Data:</b></font></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Arial" size="3">You are free to 
use any data that fits your project goals and that you can find authorized 
access to. In addition, please feel free to contact us 4 instructors if you 
would like to discuss dataset option in the specific domains of social science 
data (Prof. Rawlings), biology data (Prof. Proulx), or web API data (Profs 
Hollerer and O&#39;Donovan).</font></span></p>
<h3><b><font face="Arial">Project Presentation and Documentation:</font></b></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">Your grade for the quarter project will be based on two 
things. In lieu of a final, we&#39;ll use the time allotted during finals week so 
you can all demo your projects to the entire class. The second part of your 
grade will be based on an online documentation describing your project (web page 
or github wiki). </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Demo </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Each presenter/group will have N(15?) minutes to present, 
from start to finish, including setup time. You are responsible for making sure 
that you have all the hardware you need in the classroom. We can help you, but 
you have to tell us what you need (e.g. second display).&nbsp; You can hook up to the projector to 
show the demo itself, or to show documentation materials. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A good demo should give an overview of the project's end 
result, and then follow with a detailed discussion of the various features / 
techniques implemented and the insights generated. Put a special emphasis on pointing out the various 
design decisions you were confronted with, and how you resolved them! If you 
worked in a group, it may be helpful to have one person run the demo, while 
another talks and gestures at the screen. Each person in the group should 
describe the aspect of the project they worked on, since they have the clearest 
understanding of the particular material. Make sure you leave some time for 
questions as we encourage and value questions from other groups. Your timing should be carefully planned to show the course of 
progress in your project. Preparation will really pay off. Plan out what you're 
going to talk about and what actions you'll take in the demo to show it's 
operation in as good a light as possible. </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Online Documentation</font></b><font face="Arial"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Each group will also have to submit a write-up of the 
project, as a web page (of your choice). Please submit the write-up's URL on 
GauchoSpace by the submission 
deadline: Wednesday, March 18 (11:59:59pm). Please make sure the names of each 
member of the group is on the write-up. The documentation should 
include a brief overview of the purpose and goals of the project, followed by a 
more technical description of the mechanisms and techniques 
implemented and insights generated. Include details about the design, development process, and 
algorithms, or whatever else you feel is unique about your project. Give credit 
to external code, algorithms, research papers, models, data, and any other information you used 
in your project. You may create a small set of web pages, if you feel it helps 
your presentation, but keeping it all on one page is fine as well. Please try to 
be as clear and organized as possible. The write-up could also include some 
images, charts, and/or video clips. Don't be stingy with the media! 
Finally, please include on the web page a link to your source code (a single zip 
file or tarball) so we can see it. We don't expect to be able to run the program 
ourselves, given the different development environments being used for projects, 
but we would like to be able to examine it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The set of submitted web pages will be used to advertise 
the course to future generations of grad students.<br>
